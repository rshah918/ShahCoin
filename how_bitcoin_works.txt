My understanding of how Bitcoin works:

Transactions-->Blocks-->Blockchain

Block:
	A block contains multiple transactions. A block is generated by a miner. A block contains the hash of the previous block on the blockchain, a list of transactions, and a value called a "Nonce". To generate a block, you need to hash all 3 of these things, and see of the hash contains the correct # of leading zeros. 
	If yes: Broadcast the new block out to the network
	If no: Choose a different Nonce value and rehash. Brute forcing the correct Nonce value is how Proof-of-Work is implemented.

Blockchain Consensus:
	A node in the network accepts the longest blockchain as valid. One edge case scenario is if 2 blocks are generated at the same time. This is called a fork. To solve this, nodes keep all versions of the blockchain, and discards everything besides the longest one when a new block is eventually added. 
	Another edge case scenario: What if 2 simultaneous blocks have an overlapping set of transactions: 
		Assume block A and B are generated at the same time. Only one block will get accepted onto the blockchain. If Block B is the orphan block, then transactions in the set B-A are lost. Those transactions are then put back into each nodes mem-pool (waiting room for unconfirmed transactions), and will appear in a future block.
